          I&#39;ve built responsive frontend applications using React and Tailwind CSS, and developed backend APIs with Node.js and MongoDB. I love turning ideas into real-world projects that are clean, functional, and scalable.

            Currently, I&#39;m exploring system design, deepening my understanding of DSA, and contributing to open-source communities. I&#39;m actively seeking internship opportunities where I can grow and make meaningful impact through code.
